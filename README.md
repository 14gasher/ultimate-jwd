### The Interview

Interviews are stressful - so, to help out, here's all of the initial questions I'll be asking. Take advantage of it and come prepared. I will ask follow up questions as they come up. Also, as part of this interview, I'm including a little mini project (details follow this section), and we'll talk about your experience with it. If you have questions about the project or interview, feel free to contact me at asher.gunsay@gmail.com. Interviews will be help via Zoom on March 13th, 2021. Reach out to me at asher.gunsay@gmail.com to set it up, with your resume and anything else you'd like to share.

##### Questions

**Basic Questions**

1. What brought you here to Logan? If you're going to school, why did you choose that school?
2. Why do you want this job?
3. Where do you hope to go with your career?
4. What have you built that you are most proud of?
5. What have you built that you are least proud of?
6. What's been your best development experience?
7. What's been your hardest development experience?
8. What's one question you'd like me to ask you?

**Project Questions**

1. What is the difference between `props` and `state`?
2. When would you use `useState` vs `useReducer`? (checkout `src/TicTacToe/Space.js` for an example of `useState`, and `src/TicTacToe/index.js` for `useReducer`).
3. Did you get stuck anywhere?
4. If the client behind this project asked you to save games (just for Tic Tac Toe, not Ultimate), what would you do (what would you ask the client, how would you store the games, etc)?
5. How would you describe your experience with this project?

### Project

I don't care if you finish this project. I do care if you try at all. This gives me something to talk to you about where we both know what was happening, and should get you set up for web development down the road. Good luck! And remember, if you get stuck, feel free to send me an email at asher.gunsay@gmail.com.

##### Project Setup

1. If you don't already have it installed, install the following:
   1. git
   2. nodejs
   3. yarn
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `yarn` to install all necessary dependencies in the project folder.
4. Run `yarn start` to start the development server. It will allow you to view the project on `localhost:3000`. Anytime you save your code, it will refresh there in real time with the changes.

##### Project Details

Currently, this is a fun little Tic-Tac-Toe game. Yippee.

Familiarize yourself with the rules of [`Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe` here.](https://ultimate-t3.herokuapp.com/rules)

Pretty cool right? So, as I'm sure you can guess, the project is to take the little tic-tac-toe game we have here and make ultimate tic-tac-toe.
